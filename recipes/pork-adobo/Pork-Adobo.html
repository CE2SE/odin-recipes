    <h2>Filipino style Pork Adobo</h2>
    <p>
        Adobo is a popular dish in Filipino cuisine, characterized by its savory, tangy flavors. It typically involves marinating meat—commonly chicken, pork, or beef—in a mixture of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, bay leaves, and peppercorns. The marinated meat is then simmered until tender, resulting in a dish that has a rich, aromatic sauce. Variations may include different ingredients like coconut milk or potatoes, and it's often served with rice. Adobo is beloved for its depth of flavor and is considered a national dish of the Philippines, reflecting the country’s culinary heritage.
